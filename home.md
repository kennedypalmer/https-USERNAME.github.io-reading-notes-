## **INTRO**
  My name is Kennedy Palmer- welcome to my first website! ðŸ”‘
  I am 25 years old living in Birmingham, AL and entering into the daunting and exciting world of Software Engineering. 
  I have been trial and erroring through this process, and by consequence learning a lot on the way. I've highlighted the basics of what I've learned so far, and expect to use these reading notes for recall as I continue on.
