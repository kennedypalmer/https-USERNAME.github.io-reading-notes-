# Mastering Markdown 

## **Who is she?**
>Markdown is an easy to read, easy to write syntax for formatting plain text. It's mostly just regular text with some non-alphabetic, yet familiar, characters thrown in. 
You can use markdown in ____, _______ in issues, and ______ requests, or files that have .md or markdown extension.


## **Syntax Guide** 

#### _Headers_: 
```#``` is the ______, or h1, header. 

```###### ``` is the ______, or h6, header. 

#### _Emphasis_: 
```* ``` and ``` _ ``` makes the text ______. 
``` ** ``` and ``` __``` makes the text _______. 

##### _Lists_: 

An _______ list refers to a bulleted list, by using ```*``` or ```-``` in front of the item. 
An _______ list refers to a number list, by using a number, ``` 1.```, in front of an item. 

#### _Images vs. Links_: 

To input a link you add ________, or ``` [alt text]```, around the text and _________, or ```(site's URL)```, around the site's URL, with no spaces in between the two. 

To input an image you add an ________, or ```!```, before the brackets for your alt text. The alt text will still be bracketed & the URL will still have parentheses. 


Note: These are the basics and have been easy to pick up on, execute, and even remember. This is a watered down version of other syntax we will be using as we grow our skills. 
Here is a clean list of [Markdown basics](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for reference as we go on, and a simple lil chart to put a pin in as well:
