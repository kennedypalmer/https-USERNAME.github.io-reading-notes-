# **Coder's Computer 101: Diving into Web Dev**

#### What is a Text Editor? 
> A piece of software that allows you to write, manage, or "wrangle" text to make it meaningful- like building a website. 
- One of the most important tools as a web developer: what a canvas is to a painter, a text editor is to a web dev. 
- Important Features: 
    1. Code Completion 
    2. Syntax Highlighting 
    3. Themes
    4. Extensions, extensions, extensions 
###### 1. **Code Completion** 
  - Allows you to start typing and will show suggestions based on what you originally typed.
  - Think predictive text when you're typing a message on your phone- a nifty tool to help complete code without errors. 
###### 2. **Syntax Highlighting**
  - Feature that takes the text you type and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. 
  - Think literal highlighters and how they jump from the page to label. Ex: in a paragraph, highlighting all nouns blue, all verbs green, and all adjectives yellow. 
###### 3. **Themes** 
  - Allows you to change color of background, series of colors in text, and could affect other aspects of editing. 
  - Think about the preference of day vs. night mode on your phone- this may be better for your eyes if you spend long hours scrolling. Same with the theme settings on a text editor!

#### Software 
> Whatcha workin with and where can you find it? 

###### 1. **Software Already on your Computer**
  - Text editors already exist on your computer
  - Personally speaking, since I have a Mac there is **_Text Edit_**.
  - When using a text editing software already on your computer it's best to keep it simple and organized. 
  - Make sure to use plain text editing when coding + be sure to create folders and sub-folders to save and tuck away your work. 
###### 2. 3rd Party Options
> Text Editors to consider
  - Notepad for Windows
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) 
    1. Has Emet shorthand for HTML and CSS built in, syntax highlighing, themes, extensions, bells, whistles, etc. 
    2. Note: a fan favorite
  - Atom- created by Git Hub 

#### Text Editors vs. IDEs
> Think about Microsoft Excel vs. all of the apps in the Office Suite 

*Text Editor*- "wrangles" your text into something meaningful
*IDE (Integrated Development Environment)*- is a suite of different software- the text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger. A big blanket, if you will.
