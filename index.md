## Growth Mindset + Me 

My name is Kennedy Palmer. I'm a 25 year old woman born and raised in Birmingham, AL. I am currently on the Experience Team at Shipt after a windy road from school to college, to the service industry. Outside of work I read novels, write poetry, and climb big rocks. My roots and my experiences since being out on my own as adult have shaped me to be adventurous, persistent, and always eager to learn something new. I am venturing into the tech world through the Pivot Technology Software Development program for this reason-- to learn. You can follow this tech journey on my [Github Profile page] (https://github.com/kennedypalmer).

A growth mindset to me means to insist on evovling, and being devoted to learning from change. ***Onward*** is the one word mantra I have adopted because that is what one must do to develop into a spiritually strong, successful human. I have learned that by embracing change and discomfort as tools to move *forward*, instead of seeing the two as daunting and hard, push me towards growth. During this program, I vow to always remind myself of the why I am doing this, and continue to be inspired by the process. 


### ***WHY?*** ðŸŒ»
``` 
I am going to remind myself of the "why?" I am doing this program: 
I am here to develop my career and become completely independent through learning this skillset.
I am also feeding my personal need for knowledge and creativity. 

``` 

### ***YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET*** ðŸŒº

I am going to remind myself that though change can be stressful, it is crucial to growth. I am going to be resilient when faced with a problem that seems impossible to solve, and use any feedback or criticism as a chance to adapt. Discomfort can be the best motivator. 




### ***BEAUTY IN THE DISCOMFORT*** ðŸŒ¼

The discomfort means that I am being challenged, 
and that means I am learning. I can remember this when grinding out long hours and problems. 
 while also giving myself grace. I know that spiritual strength is built when I persevere through not understanding something, and the reward of learning is so much sweeter because of this. 




### ***Onward*** ðŸŒ¸

In the words of **Octavia Butler**:
> Prodigy is, at its essence, adaptability and persistent, positive obsession. Without persistence what remains is an enthusiasm of the moment. Without adaptability, what remains may be channeled into destructive fanaticism. Without positive obsession, there is nothing at all.
