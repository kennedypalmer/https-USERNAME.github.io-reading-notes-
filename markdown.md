Mastering Markdown

Markdown- Easy to read, easy to write syntax for formatting plain text. Mostly just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in. 
You can use markdown in (Gists), (comments) in issues, and (pull) requests, files with the (.md) or (markdown) extension. 

Syntax Guide
Headers: 
# is the (largest) header. 
####### is the (smallest) header. 

Emphasis:
* and _ will make (italics). 
** and __ will make (bold). 

__**__ will combine (italics) and (bold).  

Lists: 
(Unordered) refers to a bulleted list, by using * or - in front of the item. 
(Ordered) refers to a numbered list, by using a number, 1. , in front of an item. 

Images vs. Links: 
To input a link you add (brackets), or [], around the text and (parentheses), or (), around the site's URL. 
To input an image, you add an (exclamation point), or ! , before the alt text. The alt text will be bracketed, and the URL will have parentheses.
